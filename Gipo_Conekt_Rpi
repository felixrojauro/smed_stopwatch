Its working now
still missing translation on export file . Sorry about that. Anyway its fairly easy to understand


ok. I understand
and thank You very much 

no problem now you need to connect it to the relay 

to test it you can put a simple wire between gpio 18 and ground

CAn you see the image ? you need to plug wire between GPIO18 and any GND 

yes pin 25 and 18?

no no . Gpio18 is pin 12
ground it can be pin 25 or other 

ok, Gipo18 is 24v end 12 (-) yes or not?

Nie :) gpio is 5v max
you must use a relay that comutates at 24v from troax and then on the other side of relay 

to ACT as interrupt 


TAK, zrozumiałem Cię :-) Yes no problem

Thansks You very much me supprt :-)

De nada !( your welcome) . Please dont put 24v on raspberry , it will burn !! 
 spio18 is already 5v and makes program work when it closes with gnd
 any question contact me 
 Yes, yes thank you.
